The provided code seems to be a complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript setup for a personal website. Let me address each of your questions:

### Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen on your website?

The website seems to cover various concepts such as HTML structure, CSS styling for responsiveness, JavaScript for interactivity, and some external libraries like Anime.js for animation.

- **HTML**: The HTML code includes different sections for the profile, about, interests, projects, and contact. It uses semantic tags like `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc., for structuring the content.

- **CSS**: The CSS file (style.css) is used for styling the website. It covers general styling, animations, and responsiveness using media queries.

- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript code (script.js) includes functions for toggling the hamburger menu, playing a surprise on button click, and creating flying GIFs.

### What was your inspiration for the design of the website?

The design of the website seems to be inspired by modern web design trends. It includes a clean layout, a navigation menu with a hamburger icon for smaller screens, smooth animations, and a mix of vibrant and subtle colors. The use of circular profile pictures and icons adds a modern touch.

### What was your approach in creating the content of the website?

The content appears to be a personal portfolio website, introducing the owner (Paulo Buan) with sections like profile, about, interests, projects, and contact. Each section provides relevant details, and the content is organized in a visually appealing manner.

### How is your website creative?

The creativity of the website can be observed in various aspects:

- **Animations**: The website includes animations for the logo, surprise button, and flying GIFs, adding an element of surprise and playfulness.

- **Color Palette**: The color scheme, including the use of #ff66b2 (pinkish) and black, provides a visually pleasing and modern appearance.

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience across devices.

- **Surprise Element**: The inclusion of a surprise button and associated animations adds a creative and interactive aspect to the website.

### What did you use to deploy your website?

The code provided is for the front-end part of a website, and it doesn't include information about the deployment. To deploy the website, you would typically need a web hosting service. Common choices include platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or traditional web hosting services.


Through the LT0 Git setup, I gained proficiency in version control, facilitating collaborative web development. Efficient use of Git ensures organized code management, allowing seamless collaboration with team members and easy tracking of changes. This skill is pivotal for maintaining a structured and reliable codebase, contributing to effective project development.

In LT1 Web Design, mastering the art of dividing, spanning, and positioning elements became foundational for creating visually appealing and responsive layouts. Understanding the intricacies of the CSS box model and employing techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox enabled me to craft designs that adapt seamlessly across various devices. Embracing CSS frameworks and incorporating principles of UI and UX further enhanced the user experience, emphasizing the importance of both technical expertise and design sensibility in effective web design.


reflecting on the challenges encountered during these tasks is crucial for continuous improvement. One notable struggle was navigating the learning curve associated with Git during LT0. Understanding concepts like branches, merges, and conflict resolution demanded focused effort. Overcoming these challenges, however, significantly improved my ability to collaborate on coding projects and manage version control effectively.

In LT1 Web Design, grappling with responsive design posed its own set of challenges. Ensuring that layouts seamlessly adapted to different screen sizes required a deep dive into media queries and responsive design principles. The struggle was transformative, as it pushed me to consider user experiences across diverse devices, ultimately elevating the quality of the designs produced. Embracing challenges in these tasks not only enhanced technical skills but also fostered adaptability and problem-solving, essential attributes in the dynamic field of web development.

*Notes*

Improving my website in the future is definitely on the agenda, and one key lesson learned is to ditch the cramming approach. It's crystal clear now that giving the creative process ample time leads to better results. Rushing through it was my bad, and I won't make that mistake again. Slow and steady wins the web design race.

Speaking of the creative process, animations and design are my jam. I love making things visually pop. However, the bane of my existence is block designing and font pairing. It's like my creative nemesis. I reckon in the future, I need to tackle this head-on. Maybe take a course or two, gather some design inspo, and conquer the art of pairing fonts without breaking a sweat. Because let's face it, a stunning website is the perfect fusion of sleek animations and, unfortunately, blocky font challenges.
